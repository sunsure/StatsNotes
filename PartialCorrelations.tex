\subsection{Partial Correlations}

This is the correlation of two variables while controlling for a third (or more) other variable.

The Technique is commonly used in "causal" modelling of small models(3-5 variables)

\subsection{Order of Correlation}
a First -order partial correlation is one with a single control variable (2nd order - with 2 control variables)

a zero-order is one with no controls (i.e. normal correlation of 2 variables)
