\subsection{Censoring}
Censoring occurs when the value of an observation is only partially known. 
For example, suppose a study is conducted to measure the impact of a drug on mortality. 
In such a study, it may be known that an individual's age at death is at least 75 years. 
Such a situation could occur if the individual withdrew from the study at age 75, or if the individual is currently 
alive at the age of 75.
Censoring also occurs when a value occurs outside the range of a measuring instrument. 
For example, a bathroom scale might only measure up to 300 lbs. 
If a 350 lb individual is weighed using the scale, the observer would only know that the individual's weight is at 
least 300 lbs.
