\section{Introduction to Statistical Genetics}

Statistical Genetics is the study of Allele Frequecny distribution and change under the influence of 4 evolutionary processes

\begin{enumeration}
\item Natural Selection
\item Genetic Drift
\item Mutation
\item Gene Flow
\end{enumeration}

Quantitative Genetics is the study of continuous traits (such as height, weight) and their underlying mechanisms.

Allele : One of several different forms of genes. Allels are now understood to be alternative DNA sequences at the same physical gene locus, which may or may not
result in different phenotypic traits.

Genotypes : Genetic constitution of a cell, organism or individual. (i.e. the specific allel makeup of an individual)
Phenotype : Any observable trait of an organism, morphology behaviour etc

Genotype +  Environment = phonotype
