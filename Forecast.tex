\subsection{Simple Additive Decomposition Moel}
\[ x_t = m_t + s_t +z_t \]


\subsection{Multiplicative Model}
\[ x_t = m_t \times s_t +z_t \]


If the random variation is modelleed by a multiplicative factor, and the variable is positive, an additive decomposition for $log(x_t)$
could be used
\[ log(x_t) = m_t \times s_t +z_t \]
This form tends to introduce a bias on the predictions, so care must be taken.
