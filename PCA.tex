\section{Principal Component Analysis}
PCA is defined as the orthogonal linear transformation that transforms data to a new co-ordinate system, such that the greatest variance by any projection
of the projection of the data comes to lie on the first co-ordinate (called the first principal component).

\[ Y^{T} = X^{T}W = V \Sigma \]

where $V \Sigma W^{T}$ is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix $X^{T}$
