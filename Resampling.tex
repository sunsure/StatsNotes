\section{Resampling}

Resampling is used to estimate the precision of sampling statistics by using subsets of available data (jackknife) or drawing randomly with replacement form a set of data points (bootstrapping).

Common resampling techniqes include

\begin{itemize}
\item Bootstrapping
\item Jackknife
\item Permutation Tests
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Permutation Test}

(Also called a randomization testm or an exact test)

This is a type of statistical significance test in which a reference distribution is obtained by 
calculating all possiblee values of a tests statistic under re-arrangements of the labels of the observed data points.

Permutation test theory has evolved from the work of R.A. Fisher and E.J.G Pitman in the 1930s.
