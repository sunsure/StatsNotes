### BH Test

Benjamini and Hochberg [1995] proposed a step-up procedure controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) under the assumption that test statistics are independent.

### False Discovery Rate 
False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a new approach to the multiple comparisons problem. FDR controls the expected proportion of false positives instead of controlling the chance of any false positives (as Bonferroni methods do).A FDR threshold is determined from the observed p-value distribution.

### Comparison of Tests

Simes’ test for testing the intersection null hypothesis is generalized to control the k-FWER weakly, that is, under the intersection null hypothesis, and Hochberg’s stepup procedure for simultaneous testing of the individual null hypotheses is generalized to control the k-FWER strongly, that is, under any configuration of the true and false null hypotheses.
